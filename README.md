# dissertation-biology

My Computer Science third year project (undergraduate dissertation) on Gene Regulatory Networks and Synthetic Biology.

## Background

Please read the included `Dissertation.pdf` file for the background of the project and how to use it.

## Installation

First, install required packages with pip:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Secondly, you will need to install [graphviz](https://graphviz.org/download/) on your system (this is in addition to the Python package you had to install in the previous step).

## Running the program

Once you have installed all dependencies mentioned in the "Installation" section, run `src/ui/gui.py` to launch the program's main GUI:

```bash
cd src

# Make sure you are in the src directory
python3 ui/gui.py
```
